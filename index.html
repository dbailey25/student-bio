    <p>I was born in Hawaii and grew up in California (my dad was in the Navy). I moved to New York city in '06, well technically Jersey City, NJ but it's basically the 6th burrough of NYC. I then made my way to Washington D.C. in '08. Now I live just east of Capitol Hill; my wife and I love that it is so convenient to the city but still has a residential, small town feel. In June of '16 we had a daughter, whos is the most amazing and challenging thing that we have ever experienced.</p>
    <p>After highschool in San Diego I attended college near Los Angeles, at Cal Poly in Pomona. I initially studied Mechanical Engineering but ultimately switched to Business Management which was my major for my bachelor's degree. It was here where my interest in online applications was developed.</p>
    <p>I began my career in the Internet industry as an Account Executive for a start up company, Akiva, that was pioneering the use of online communication tools, such as chat, IM and message boards, in the workplace. From there I transitioned into a Technical Support role for a division of Nielsen that focused on demographic analysis and store location planning via a suite of online and desktop applications. I became a Team Leader in this department before branching out into their sales group, but as an embedded Technical Support Specialist. From there I moved into a Product Management role, responsible for several online applications. These experiences eventually afforded me the opportunity for a Senior Product Manager role at Verisign. There I was responsible for their first publically accesible platform for domain name search and analysis, <a href="https://domainscope.com" target="_blank">DomainScope.com</a> as well as Data Analyzer, an API based tool for high volume analysis of traffic to unregistered domain names. A recent health scare and the new perspective provided to me by my daughter have led me to the realization that what I was doing for a living and what I was passionate about were not well enough aligned. So, I began my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer.</p>
